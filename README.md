# mesh-blunt-flaredcone-withShock-V1.0

mesh-blunt-flaredcone-withShock generator V1.0, blunted flared cone with small medium-radius

the outline is a parabolic line conjucted with a linear line

## Version: Beta V1.0
Main Function: generate the whole mesh block  of the blunthead-straightcone-flaredcone model

Exceptional Mode: increase the mesh density on both sides of the input local shock curve
